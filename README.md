## Features and User Stories
<details>
<summary>FEATURE 1: FILTER EVENTS BY CITY</summary>

As a user, I should be able to filter events by city. So that I can see a list of events taking place in that city.

- **Scenario 1:** User opens the app and has searched a city.

- **Given** the main page with search option has been opened, **when** the user entered a city, **then** they should be shown upcoming events for that city.

- **Scenario 2:** User opens the app and hasn't searched a city.

- **Given** the main page with search option has been opened, **when** the user opens the app, **then** they should be shown a list of all events for all the cities available.

- **Scenario 3:** User can select a city from the suggested list.

- **Given** user was typing "Berlin" in the city textbox _AND_ the list of suggested cities is showing, **when** the user selects a city (e.g., "Berlin, Germany") from the list, **then** their city should be changed to that city (i.e., "Berlin, Germany") _AND_ the user should receive a list of upcoming events in that city.

<summary>FEATURE 2: SHOW/HIDE AN EVENT'S DETAILS</summary>
As a user I should be able to show or hide event details, after I have selected a city I wanted to look up the events for.

- **Scenario 1:** An event element is collapsed by default
  - **Given** the user first opens the app **when** the user recieves the full list of events (specific for the city or all events), **then** all events will colapse by default.
- **Scenario 2:** User can expand an event to see its details
  - **Given** the user gets a list of events, **when** a user selects an event's details, **then** the details will show up for that choosen event.
- **Scenario 3:** User can collapse an event to hide its details
  - **Given** the user sees the details of an event, **when** the user presses a button to hide event's details, **then** the details of that even will be hidden.
  </details>
  
  <details>
  <summary>FEATURE 3: SPECIFY NUMBER OF EVENTS</summary>
  
As a user, I should be able to specify the number of displayed events, after I have selected the number of displayed events.

- **Scenario 1:** When user hasn't specified a number, 32 is the default number.
  - **Given** the user hasn't specified or filtered the number of events, **when** the user sees the list of events **then** the default number of displayed events will be 32.
- **Scenario 2:** User can change the number of events they want to see.
  - **Given** the user has events displayed, **when** the user chooses to change the number of events displayed, **then** the number of events displayed will update to the number the user selected.
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>FEATURE 4: USE THE APP WHEN OFFLINE</summary>
  
As a user, I should be able to get events information when offline, that was fetched while having internet connection.

- **Scenario 1:** Show cached data when there's no internet connection.
  - **Given** the user has no internet connection, **when** the user is accessing the app, **then** cached data, stored inside the app, will be provided to the user.
- **Scenario 2:** Show error when user changes the settings (city, time range).
  - **Given** the user has no internet connection, **when** the user is trying to access new event information (change the city, etc.), **then** the app will show an error.
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>FEATURE 5: ADD AN APP SHORTCUT TO THE HOME SCREEN</summary>

As a user I should be able to add a shortcut of the app to the home screen, so I can access the app quicker.

- **Scenario 1:** User can install the meet app as a shortcut on their device home screen.
  - **Given** the user wants to install the app, **when** the user selects to install the app as a shortcut, **then** a shortcut is created on users homescreen.
  </details>
  
<details>
  <summary>FEATURE 6: DISPLAY CHARTS VISUALIZING EVENT DETAILS</summary> 

As a user, I would like to be able to see a chart showing the upcoming events in each city so that I know what events are organized in which city.

- **Scenario 1:** Show a chart with the number of upcoming events in each city.
  - **Given** the user is in the events detail page, **when** the user clicks the button to see a chart of those events in all the cities as a comparison, **then** a chart with the number of upcoming events for every city, will be shown to the user.
  - </details>

**Serverless Functions**

>The Meet App can use serverless functions for event notifications, real-time data processing, user authentication, event recommendations and scalability. By leveraging serverless technology, the app can efficiently handle backend processes, provide personalized experiences, and scale according to user demand.

<!-- ### Responsive Layout & Accessibility -->

<!-- The app was tested to suit a wide spectrum of devices and with accessibility in mind.
<!-- <br>
Components incuding the modal and navigation bar are accessible to screen readers.
